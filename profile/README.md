## Hello there, fellow nerds 🤓
Welcome to this organization! Here is where I archive the coding projects I have worked on during my universities studies at [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl/). It includes assignments, personal experiments, and group projects across various courses. For some courses, I have also added theory summaries.

### Structure
Each course has its own repository, which contains a README file with additional details on the assignments/exercises/notes it contains. 
For ease of navigation, the following naming scheme is used for all repositories: `YEAR-COURSECODE-CourseName`
